abstract: In the present paper, an investigation regarding the transformations of studies published in the Brazilian Journal 
of Public Administration (RAP) from 2003 to 2016 was conducted, through bibliometric research. The main results 
indicate consolidation of the field, with an increase in the number of authors per article. Most authors were male, 
although with a high participation of female researchers, in a context where most authors are Brazilian, from public 
institutions. Case-studies, applied-approaches and quantitative methodology studies increased in comparison to 
studies published from 1994 to 2002.
